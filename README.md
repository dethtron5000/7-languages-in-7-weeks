This repository contains attempts at the coding exercises in the book "7 Languages in 7 Weeks" (http://pragprog.com/book/btlang/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks).

Documentation is likely sparse if populated at all. Accuracy is not guaranteed.  Not responsible if something causes your precious MacBook to start smoking and making weird sounds.
